# Traceroute Lab

**Goal:** See the path packets take to reach a website.

**Tool Used:** Windows PowerShell

**Steps I Took:**  
1. Opened PowerShell  
2. Ran `tracert google.com`  
3. Observed each hop along the path

**What I Learned:**  
Traceroute shows all the routers (hops) between your computer and the destination, helping troubleshoot network paths.
